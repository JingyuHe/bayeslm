# bayeslm
This package implements elliptical slice sampler for Bayesian linear regression, with multiple shrinkage priors (horseshoe, Laplace and ridge). Our approach is much more efficient than regular Gibbs sampler.

## Installment
install.packages("bayeslm")

or

library(devtools)
install_github("JingyuHe/bayeslm")
